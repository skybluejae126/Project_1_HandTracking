# ðŸ“– Project_1_HandTracking ðŸ“–

## âœŽ About âœŽ
  - Unity, python, opencv, mediapipe

## âœŽ Purpose of this project âœŽ
  - Most modern AR tracking solutions rely on Apple's ARKit. This project aims to use a webcam or a regular smartphone along with Python's MediaPipe to achieve tracking.
The goal is to track body movements in Python and replicate them with a 3D model in Unity.

## âœŽ Goals âœŽ
<span style="color:red;">Currently, this project supports tracking only one hand.</span> However, future updates will enable dual-hand and full-body tracking.

- **Real-time Tracking**: Track hands or body movements in real time and apply them to a 3D model.
  - *Hand Mode*: Tracks only the hands.
  - *Body Mode*: Tracks the entire body.
  - *Sign Language Education*: The 3D hand model can be used for sign language education.
- **Partial Tracking & Data Merging**:
  - Record and merge tracking data for specific body parts.
  - Track different body parts (e.g., hands, torso) separately and combine them later into a single sequence.
  - This feature could be useful for 3D motion capture applications, such as dance cover videos.

## âœŽ File Structure âœŽ

/Project_1_HandTracking
â”‚â”€â”€ /Example_1                    # MediaPipe sample scripts
â”‚â”€â”€ /P1_One_Hand_Tracking         # Python script for tracking & Unity project for rendering 3D model

```
1. **Example_1**:
   - Contains sample scripts utilizing MediaPipe.
   - If image or video files are placed in the same directory, the script can visualize how MediaPipe tracks hand movements.
2. **P1_One_Hand_Tracking**:
   - Includes the Python script for tracking and the Unity project for rendering the 3D model.

## âœŽ How It Works âœŽ
1. Connect a webcam or an Android smartphone to a PC.
   - On Windows 11 or later, the built-in smartphone linking feature can be used to treat the phone as a webcam.
2. Use Python's MediaPipe to track the hand.
   - MediaPipe detects 21 landmark points that define hand movements.
3. Send landmark data from Python to Unity via socket communication in JSON format.
4. Use this data to animate a 3D hand model in Unity.

## âœŽ How to Use âœŽ
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/skybluejae126/Project_1_HandTracking.git
cd P1_One_Hand_Tracking
```
```sh
# Make venv Python version 3.8.x
py -3.8 -m venv venv
```
```sh
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
